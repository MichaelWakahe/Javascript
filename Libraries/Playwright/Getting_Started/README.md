## Getting Started

Run the following commands to install packages:

* npm install

Run the following command to run the tests:

`npx playwright test`

The tests run against the Playwright website so there is no need to have a local server running.

`npx playwright test --ui`

Check which version of Playwright you have by running the following command:
`npx playwright --version`
