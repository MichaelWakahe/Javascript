# README
These are examples from the PluralSight course `Typescript 4: Getting Started`.

The webpack development server was broken as at the time I did the exercises. I opted to use Apache web server for my 
local testing.

Ensure that you have NodeJS available in your path.

To install Typescript globally, run `npm install -g typescript`.
