This is based on the course *JavaScript Unit Testing with Jest by Gabriel McNeilly*.

The course was created using:

- JavaScript 2022
- Jest v29
- Node.js v18

## Notes

- No configuration is required to get started with Jest.
- Tests run in parallel.
- By default Jest tests time out after 5 seconds.
- Matchers are used to perform validation.
